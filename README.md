# My Favorite Series: Modern family



## Overview
Told from the perspective of an unseen documentary filmmaker, the series offers an honest, often-hilarious perspective of family life. Parents Phil and Claire yearn for an honest, open relationship with their three kids. But a daughter who is trying to grow up too fast, another who is too smart for her own good, and a rambunctious young son make it challenging. Claire's dad, Jay, and his Latina wife, Gloria, are raising two sons together, but people sometimes believe Jay to be Gloria's father. Jay's gay son, Mitchell, and his partner, Cameron, have adopted a little Asian girl, completing one big -- straight, gay, multicultural, traditional -- happy family.

### Key Characters
- **Claire**: is the wife of Phil Dunphy, the daughter of Jay, Mitchell's older sister, Gloria's stepdaughter, Manny's stepsister, Joe's half sister, and the helicopter soccer mom of the Dunphy family and its three very different kids.
- **Phil**: is a real estate agent who is very confident in his work, once saying, "I could sell a fur coat to an Eskimo."
- **Haley**: She is concerned about her social standing at school, including her sex life, and is frequently embarrassed by her parents' conduct.

## Quotes
> "Family is family. Whether it's the one you start out with, the one you end up with, or the family you gain along the way."
## Conclusion
Not everyone is perfect and Modern Family shows that no matter what decisions you make you will always have your family. Many viewers can relate this to their families because it is something that is an occurrence or problem in every family.
